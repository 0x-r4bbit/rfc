## Abstract

Waku is a privacy-preserving peer-to-peer messaging protocol for resource restricted devices. It implements PubSub in libp2p and adds capabilities on top of it. These capabilities are: (i) retrieving historical messages for mostly-offline devices (ii) adaptive nodes, allowing for heterogenerous nodes to contribute, and (iii) bandwidth preservation for light nodes. This makes it ideal for running a p2p protocol on mobile.

Historically, it has its roots in Waku v1 [xx5], which stems from Whisper [xx6], originally part of the Ethereum stack. However, Waku v2 acts more as a thin wrapper for PubSub and has a different API. It is implemented in an iterative manner where initial focus is on porting essential functionality to libp2p. See here for a rough road map [xx7].

## Motivation

TODO

*NOTE: Should elaborate on privacy-preserving messaging for resource restricted devices, etc. Also Waku v1 history briefly.*

## Definitions

TODO

## Underlying Transports and Prerequisites

TODO Right now this is more like a set of components

### Peer Discovery

WakuSub and PubSub don't provide an peer discovery mechanism. This has to be provided for by the environment.

### PubSub interface

Waku v2 is implementing the PubSub interface in Libp2p. See PubSub spec [xx2] for more details.

### Protocol Identifier

The current protocol identifier is: `/wakusub/0.0.1` [xx1].

**TODO Update to 2.0.0-alpha0**

### FloodSub

WakuSub is currently a subprotocol of FloodSub. Future versions of WakuSub will support GossipSub 1 [xx3] and GossipSub 1.1 [xx4].

### Bridge mode

To maintain compatibility with Waku v1, a bridge mode can be achieved. See separate spec.

TODO Detail this in a separate spec

## Wire Specification

We are using protobuf RPC messages between peers. Here's what a message looks like, as defined in the PubSub interface.


*NOTE: Should contain protobuf definitions that cover essentials of Waku v1. In cases where it doesn't cover, we can defer to siblings/child specs, e.g. such as the data field for encryption, etc.*

### Messages

```
message Message {
	optional string from = 1;
	optional bytes data = 2;
	optional bytes seqno = 3;
	repeated string topicIDs = 4;
	optional bytes signature = 5;
	optional bytes key = 6;
}
```

TODO Detail options and what's in data, additional methods, etc

### SubOpts
